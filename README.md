## 1. Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide the R code used to create the 10 GCRMN (*Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network*) regions and the 48 GCRMN subregions. The GCRMN regions are the following:

* Australia
* Brazil
* Caribbean
* EAS = East Asian Seas
* ETP = Eastern Tropical Pacific
* Pacific
* PERSGA = Regional Organization for the Conservation of the Environment of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden
* ROPME = Regional Organization for the Protection of the Marine Environment
* South Asia
* WIO = Western Indian Ocean

## 2. How the regions were created?

The raw data used to create the GCRMN regions and subregions where obtained from the *Marine Ecoregions of the World* ([Spalding *et al.*, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1641/B570707)). The corresponding shapefile of these raw data are located in `data\meow` (*Marine_Ecoregions_Of_the_World__MEOW_.shp*). The ecoregions were aggregated to create the 10 GCRMN regions and 48 GCRMN subregions. The resulting data are located in `data\gcrmn-regions`, either in RData (*gcrmn_regions.RData* and *gcrmn_subregions.RData*) or in shapefile format (*gcrmn_regions.shp* and *gcrmn_subregions.shp*).
